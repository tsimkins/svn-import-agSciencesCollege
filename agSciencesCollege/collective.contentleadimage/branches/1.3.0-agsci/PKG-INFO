        ==========================================
        
        Overview
        --------
        
        This products adds complete support for adding descriptive image to any
        Archetypes based content in Plone site. Each object has new tab "Edit lead
        image", which allows to upload new or remove current image. It is similar
        behaviour as Plone News Item (you can add image to news item and this image is
        displayed in news item overview listing.
        
        There is folder_leadimage_view page template, which can be used to list all
        items in the folder together with images attached.
        
        There is configuration control panel, where you can set maximum width and height
        of the uploaded images. The widht and height is applied on each image upload
        (image is automatically resized). You can specify smaller width and height 
        which is used as image preview in the below content title viewlet (next to 
        content Description). Large image is used in the above content body viewlet
        (floated left at the top of content body). 
        
        Below content title viewlet is preffered, but Manager can easily switch
        the viewlets on/off in the control panel.
        
        There is FieldIndex and metadata in portal_catalog: hasContentLeadImage
        (True/False). This may help developers to create own templates optimized 
        for displaying lead image.
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        If you are using zc.buildout and the plone.recipe.zope2instance recipe to manage
        your project, you can do this:
        
        Add ``collective.contentleadimage`` to the list of eggs to install, e.g.::
            
            [buildout]
            ...
            eggs =
                ...
                collective.contentleadimage
                
        Tell the plone.recipe.zope2instance recipe to install a ZCML slug::
            
            [instance]
            recipe = plone.recipe.zope2instance
            ...
            zcml =
                collective.contentleadimage
                
        Re-run buildout, e.g. with::
          
            $ ./bin/buildout
                
        More detailed installation instructions may be found in docs/INSTALL.txt.

            - fixed version number
        
        1.1.5 - 2009/09/02
        
            - use plone.indexer if possible
        
            - added controlapnel icon
        
            - reindex hasContentLeadImage index on reinstall
        
        1.1.4 - 2008/12/16
        
            - fixed bug in migration from version 0.x. Thanks to Ben Chodoroff for
              pointing to it.
        
            - added Italian translation. Thanks to [paulox]
        
            - fixed spelling
        
        1.1.3 - 2008/10/14
        
            - be more careful when accessing cli_properties property sheet in schema
              extender. It may be called too soon and cause AttributeError.
        
            - added uninstall code which removes configlet
        
        1.1.2 - 2008/10/10
        
            - make lead image field language dependent. This fixes problem with
              Linguaplone and it helps to make multi language screenshots, for example.
        
        1.1.1 - 2008/10/10
        
            - fixed body viewlet - image tag was there even if there was no image
        
            - fixed potential error when object schema has no 'description' field.
        
        1.1 - 2008/09/23
        
            - moved integer and string properties from propertiestool.xml to
              setuphandlers, because properties were overriden with default
              values on reinstall.
        
            - removed max size settings from the controlpanel and reuse max_size from
              ATContentTypes settings (zconf.ATNewsItem.max_image_dimension)
        
            - images may be captioned
        
            - if image is displayed in the body, it is possible to display image
              fullscreen (the same as newsitem image)
        
            - it is possible to specify, which scale will be used for displaying the
              image in "description" part and which in "body" part.
        
            - make images "newsitem" like. Image tags uses the same CSS classes as
              news items, leadImage field uses the same scales as News Item plus one
              special 'leadimage' scale defined by user in the controlpanel.
        
            - it is possible to set allowed_types. Document and Folder are allowed
              by default.
        
            - changed CSS - define float on the leadimage-wrapper to easily
              style leadimage itself (for example for adding border around the image)
        
        1.0.1 - 2008/09/11
        
            - fixed dependency on plone.browserlayer
        
            - make extender browser layer aware
        
        1.0 - 2008/09/09
        
            - MIGRATION REQUIRED !
              rewritten using archetypes.schemaextender. If you upgrade from
              version <1.0 please don't forget to run upgrade step from
              portal_setup/Upgrades, choose the collective.contentleadimage profile,
              check the (0.3 - 1.0) upgrade step and press Upgrade button.
              [naro]

            - it is possible to specify maxwidth and maxheight in the controlpanel
              [naro]
        
            - created new viewlet in AboveContentBody viewlet manager. This viewlet
              displays large version of the image (size specified as maxwidth/maxheight
              in the controlpanel). It is possible to switch on/off both viewlets
              in @@manage-viewlets or in leadimage control panel.
              [naro]
        
        0.4 - 2008/09/03
        
            - fixed portal action condition. There is new browser view which checks
              if object provides ILeadImageable interface. This view is called from
              action condition.
              [naro]
        
        0.3 - 2008/09/03
