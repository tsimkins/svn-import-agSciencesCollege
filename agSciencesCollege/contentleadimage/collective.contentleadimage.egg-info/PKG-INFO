        ==========================================
        
        Overview
        --------
        
        This products adds complete support for adding descriptive image to any
        Archetypes based content in Plone site. Each object has new tab "Edit lead
        image", which allows to upload new or remove current image. It is similar
        behaviour as Plone News Item (you can add image to news item and this image is
        displayed in news item overview listing.
        
        There is folder_leadimage_view page template, which can be used to list all
        items in the folder together with images attached.
        
        There is configuration control panel, where you can set maximum width and height
        of the uploaded images. The widht and height is applied on each image upload
        (image is automatically resized). You can specify smaller width and height
        which is used as image preview in the below content title viewlet (next to
        content Description). Large image is used in the above content body viewlet
        (floated left at the top of content body).
        
        Below content title viewlet is preffered, but Manager can easily switch
        the viewlets on/off in the control panel.
        
        There is FieldIndex and metadata in portal_catalog: hasContentLeadImage
        (True/False). This may help developers to create own templates optimized
        for displaying lead image.

        1.1.2 - 2008/10/10
        
        - make lead image field language dependent. This fixes problem with
        Linguaplone and it helps to make multi language screenshots, for example.
        
        1.1.1 - 2008/10/10
        
        - fixed body viewlet - image tag was there even if there was no image
        
        - fixed potential error when object schema has no 'description' field.
        
        1.1 - 2008/09/23
        
        - moved integer and string properties from propertiestool.xml to
        setuphandlers, because properties were overriden with default
        values on reinstall.
        
        - removed max size settings from the controlpanel and reuse max_size from
        ATContentTypes settings (zconf.ATNewsItem.max_image_dimension)
        
        - images may be captioned

        image in "description" part and which in "body" part.
        
        - make images "newsitem" like. Image tags uses the same CSS classes as
        news items, leadImage field uses the same scales as News Item plus one
        special 'leadimage' scale defined by user in the controlpanel.
        
        - it is possible to set allowed_types. Document and Folder are allowed
        by default.

        style leadimage itself (for example for adding border around the image)
