Changelog
=========

1.3 - 2009-04-03
----------------
* Fix the full_feed view to have fallback when getting description from an feed item as it is not a required field in the rss2 standard

1.2 - 2008-07-10
----------------

* Fix the "More ..." link of the portlet. We have to store the path to the
  context of the portlet assignment, because plone[.app].portlets doesn't
  expose it. This workaround was taken from ely.portlets.image.
  This will only work for newly created feedmixer portlets, existing ones
  will still create wrong urls in subfolders.

* Added french translation and made some i18n fixes.

1.1 - 2007-11-28
----------------

* Correct caching of mixed feed entries: caching per instance instead of
  per request meant we would never update our feed as long as the ZODB
  did not expire the assignment. Instead to cache per request and using the
  list of feed_urls of the assignment.

* Fix typo in the portletBottomLeft CSS class name.
