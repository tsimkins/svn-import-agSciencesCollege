Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        collective.portlet.feedmixer is a portlet for `Plone 3`_ which can show one
        or multiple content feeds.
        
        Feedmixer uses feedparser_ to process feeds which allows it to support RSS
        0.90, Netscape RSS 0.91, Userland RSS 0.91, RSS 0.92, RSS 0.93, RSS 0.94,
        RSS 1.0, RSS 2.0, Atom 0.3, Atom 1.0, and CDF feeds

        Installing
        ==========
        
        This package requires Plone 3.0 or later and feedparser.
        
        Installing without buildout
        ---------------------------
        
        First install feedparser. You can install this in either the system
        python path or in the lib/python directory of your Zope instance. If you
        have setuptools installed you can do this using easy_install::
        
        easy_install FeedParser
        
        If you do not have setuptools you can install it manually using the setup.py
        script in the feedparser source. If you want to install feedparser inside
        your Zope instance instead of system wide you can its ''--prefix='' option
        to install in the ''lib/python'' directory of your Zope instance.
        
        Next you need to install this package. This can also be done by installing
        it in either your system path packages or in the lib/python directory of
        your Zope instance. As with feedparser you can do this using either
        easy_install or via the setup.py script.
        
        After installing the package it needs to be registered in your Zope
        instance.  This can be done by putting a
        collective.portlet.feedmixer-configure.zcml file in the etc/pakage-includes
        directory with this content::
        
        <include package="collective.portlet.feedmixer" />
        
        or, alternatively, you can add that line to the configure.zcml in a
        package or Product that is already registered.
        
        Installing with buildout
        ------------------------
        
        If you are using `buildout`_ to manage your instance installing
        collective.portlet.feedmixer is even simpler. You can install it by adding
        it to the eggs line for your instance::
        
        [instance]
        eggs = collective.portlet.feedmixer
        zcml = collective.portlet.feedmixer
        
        The last line tells buildout to generate a zcml snippet that tells Zope
        to configure collective.portlet.feedmixer.
        
        If another package depends on the feedmixer egg or includes its zcml
        directly you do not need to specify anything in the buildout configuration:
        buildout will detect this automatically.
        
        After updating the configuration you need to run the ''bin/buildout'', which
        will take care of updating your system.
        
        .. _buildout: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/zc.buildout
        
        
        Using the portlet
        =================
        
        In order to use the feedmixer portlet you will first need to install the
        feedmixer product in your site. This is done through the standard ''Add-on
        products'' control panel in the Plone site setup. After this has been done
        a new ''Feed Mixer' portlet type will be available.
        
        Feedmixer portlets have several configurable options:
        
        Portlet Title
        This will be used as the title of the portlet.
        
        Maximum time to cache feed data
        This determins how long feeds can be cached before feedmixer will attempt
        to refresh the feed data. In order to reduce the load on other servers
        it is advisable to set this to a reasonably large value.
        
        Number of items to display
        How many items to show in the portlet.
        
        URL(s) for all feeds
        A list of URLs for all feeds. All standard RSS and Atom feeds are
        supported as well as CDF feeds.
        
        
        Performance
        ===========
        
        The portlet tries to be very friendly and will only reload a feed if required.
        It does this in several different ways.
        
        All feeds are stored in a shared cache as defined in `plone.memoize`_. This
        defaults to being a Zope RAMCache but you can choose different caches by
        registering a different ''ICacheChooser'' utility. The cache key used
        is ''collective.portlet.feedmixer.FeedCache''. For example for deployments with
        multiple Zope instances you can use a memcached_ based cache which will
        allow you to share downloaded feeds amongst all Zope instances.
        
        If a feed entry has expired in the cache it needs to be reloaded. However
        the feedmixer portlet will try to use both `ETAGs` and HTTP Last-Modified
        headers to check if the feed has been updated since the last time it was
        downloaded. If it has not been updated the timeout for the cached feed will
        be updated and continue to be used.

        Changelog
        =========
        
        1.3 - 2009-04-03
        ----------------
        * Fix the full_feed view to have fallback when getting description from an feed item as it is not a required field in the rss2 standard
        
        1.2 - 2008-07-10
        ----------------
        
        * Fix the "More ..." link of the portlet. We have to store the path to the
        context of the portlet assignment, because plone[.app].portlets doesn't
        expose it. This workaround was taken from ely.portlets.image.
        This will only work for newly created feedmixer portlets, existing ones
        will still create wrong urls in subfolders.
        [fschulze]
        
        * Added french translation and made some i18n fixes.
        [glenfant]
        
        1.1 - 2007-11-28
        ----------------
        
        * Correct caching of mixed feed entries: caching per instance instead of
        per request meant we would never update our feed as long as the ZODB
        did not expire the assignment. Instead to cache per request and using the
        list of feed_urls of the assignment.
        [wichert]
        
        * Fix typo in the portletBottomLeft CSS class name.
        [daftdog]
        
        1.0 - 2007-11-05
        ----------------
        
        * Initial release.
